Activity Week 11-2: Unit Testing Plan for Engineering Calculator
================================================================

UNIT TESTING PLAN FOR COMMAND-LINE ENGINEERING CALCULATOR

Project Overview:
-----------------
This project implements a comprehensive command-line engineering calculator
that supports:
1. Basic arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
2. Power operations
3. Root operations (square root and nth root)
4. Trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, tangent) in both radians and degrees

Project Structure:
------------------

├── calculator.py          # Core calculator module
├── cli_calculator.py     # Command-line interface
├── test_calculator.py    # Comprehensive unit tests
├── requirements.txt      # Project dependencies
└── README.md            # Project documentation

Testing Strategy:
-----------------

1. UNIT TESTING APPROACH
   - Test-driven development approach
   - Comprehensive coverage of all calculator functions
   - Edge case testing for error conditions
   - Boundary value testing
   - Floating-point precision testing

2. TEST CATEGORIES

   A. Basic Arithmetic Operations Testing:
      - Positive number operations
      - Negative number operations
      - Zero value handling
      - Mixed positive/negative operations
      - Division by zero error handling
      - Floating-point arithmetic precision

   B. Power Operations Testing:
      - Positive base with positive exponent
      - Positive base with negative exponent
      - Negative base with integer exponents
      - Fractional exponents
      - Zero base handling
      - Edge cases (0^0, large numbers)

   C. Root Operations Testing:
      - Square root of positive numbers
      - Square root of negative numbers (error cases)
      - Nth root with positive numbers
      - Nth root with negative numbers and odd roots
      - Nth root with negative numbers and even roots (error cases)
      - Zero degree root (error case)

   D. Trigonometric Functions Testing:
      - Standard angle values (0, π/2, π, 3π/2, 2π)
      - Degree and radian input modes
      - Conversion function testing
      - Precision testing for known values

   E. Edge Cases and Error Handling:
      - Very large numbers
      - Very small numbers
      - Floating-point precision issues
      - Invalid input handling
      - Error message validation

3. TEST IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

   Test Framework: Python unittest
   
   Test Classes:
   - TestEngineeringCalculator: Main functionality tests
   - TestCalculatorEdgeCases: Edge cases and error conditions
   
   Key Testing Patterns:
   - setUp() method for test fixture initialization
   - assertEqual() for exact comparisons
   - assertAlmostEqual() for floating-point comparisons
   - assertRaises() for exception testing
   - Comprehensive docstrings for each test method

4. TEST COVERAGE GOALS
   - 100% function coverage
   - 95%+ line coverage
   - All error conditions tested
   - All boundary values tested
   - Performance testing for large operations

5. CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION
   - Automated test execution
   - Code coverage reporting
   - Linting and code quality checks
   - Multi-environment testing (different Python versions)

How to Run Tests:
-----------------
1. Run all tests:
   python test_calculator.py

2. Run with verbose output:
   python test_calculator.py -v

3. Run specific test class:
   python -m unittest test_calculator.TestEngineeringCalculator

4. Run with coverage (requires coverage.py):
   coverage run test_calculator.py
   coverage report

Expected Test Results:
----------------------
All tests should pass with comprehensive coverage of:
- 20+ test methods for basic arithmetic
- 15+ test methods for power operations
- 12+ test methods for root operations
- 18+ test methods for trigonometric functions
- 6+ test methods for edge cases
- Full error condition coverage

This testing plan ensures robust, reliable calculator functionality
with comprehensive validation of all mathematical operations.
